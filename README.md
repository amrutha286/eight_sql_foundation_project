# eight_sql_foundation_project
hands-on SQL project built around a custom database (eight_sql) featuring tables like employee, branch, client, and more. This project demonstrates key SQL operations including table creation, data insertion, joins, string functions (CONCAT, TRIM), and aggregation (GROUP BY). Ideal for showcasing foundational SQL skills for data analyst roles.
 
## 🌟 Eight_SQL Project 🌟— My Hands-On SQL Journey

Hi! I’m Amrutha, worked 1 year at Cadtrains and done data analyst cource in becent technologies. This project is part of that journey—a hands-on exploration of SQL where I created and worked with a custom database called `eight_sql`.

It’s not just a bunch of queries. It’s me learning how to think like a data analyst: how to structure data, ask the right questions, and pull meaningful insights from raw tables.

''' 🧠 What This Project Is About

I designed a relational database with multiple tables like `employee`, `branch`, `client`, `works_with`, `emp_1`, and `emp_2`. Then I dove into writing queries that helped me understand:

- How to **filter and sort** data using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`
- How to **combine tables** with different types of `JOIN`s
- How to use **string functions** like `CONCAT` and `TRIM` to clean and format data
- How to **group and summarize** data using `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.
- How to write **subqueries** and explore more advanced logic


''' 🗃️ What’s Inside

Here’s how I’ve organized the project:

```
eight_sql_project/
│
├── schema.sql          # Table creation scripts
├── insert_data.sql     # Sample data for each table
├── queries.sql         # All the SQL queries I practiced
└── README.md           # This file!
```

### 🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted to go beyond just watching tutorials—I needed to *do* the work. This project helped me:
- Practice real-world SQL operations
- Understand how different tables relate to each other
- Build confidence in writing clean, structured queries
- Prepare for data analyst interviews and technical assessments

'''

### 🚀 What’s Next

I’m planning to:
- Add views and stored procedures
- Connect this database to a visualization tool like Power BI 
- Try building a mini dashboard using Python or Excel

### 🙋‍♀️ A Little About Me

I’m someone who learns best by doing. I value structure, clarity, and progress I can measure—whether it’s through certifications, projects, or just seeing my queries run successfully. I’m also curious about big ideas and inspiring leaders (Princess Diana is a favorite), and I try to bring that same drive into my career growth.
